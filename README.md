SnakeOrb is a Python based Orbital Mechanics Simulator, a simulator that can take **Keplerian Elements** or **R** and **V** vectors to produce a trajectory over a specified amount of time. SnakeOrb currently supports all planets in the solar system, as well as the Moon, and the Sun and includes perturbations due to J2 of the central body. Plots of the trajecvtory can be generated in Body Centered Inertial (BCI) frame. Earth Centered Earth Fixed and Ground Tracks are also supported for Earth orbits.

I hope to add attitude perturbations due to the atmosphere, SRP, and gravity gradient in the future.

In order to run these programs, I recommend installing **Anaconda**. Run the command: `conda env create -f conda.yaml` in your command line to create a custom conda environment named `SnakeOrb` and install the required packages.

This simulation is currently in development. To run this simulation, If you'd like to contribute, please contact me at [shrotri3@illinois.edu](mailto:shrotri3@illinois.edu).
